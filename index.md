# A Paper in Digital Organizations with Prof. Dr. Ulrich Anders

**1.	Introduction**
Venture capital enterprises follow a defined due diligence process. The aim of a due diligence is to find out whether an investor should invest in a start-up or not. This evaluation process is usually seen as very time consuming as some critical factors such as the company’s liquidity, its market position and customer base need to be considered first. Naturally, no one wants to invest in an unprofitable start-up and consequently make losses. That is why economists and researchers made it to their task to facilitate this evaluation process. The ideal solution would be a software which helps venture capitalists to collect and evaluate the most important information need to make investment decisions. The first part of the paper addresses the definition of venture capital. Furthermore, some pros and cons regarding venture capital financing will be drawn. The last chapter focusses on the application and usage of how such a software would be beneficial for venture capitalists during their diligence examination.

**2.	Definition of venture capital**
According to Gabler Wirtschaftslexikon venture capital is a time-limited equity investment in young, innovative and unlisted companies. Those companies are known as start-ups and are characterized by above-average growth potential. The venture capital business is a subset of the private equity business, which involves trading in equity in unlisted companies. Investopedia defines venture capital as a subsidizing that investors provide to start-ups and small business which have long-term growth potential. Venture capitals can be successful investors, investment banks or any other financial institutions. Important to know is that venture capital does not only mean financial funding. “Venture capital” can be also provided in form of knowledge, technical or managerial expertise. In a nutshell, venture capital is a private equity funding which allows entrepreneurs to boost its cash positions when investing in start-ups or small businesses successfully. 

**3.	Advantages and disadvantages of venture capital**
In this chapter several benefits and drawbacks will be outlined. Some advantages are mentioned by the author Humphreyson. Venture capital investors gain in their career specific skills by operating and investment activities. Consequently, they are able to add value to small businesses and have the expertise to turn an efficient idea into a successful enterprise. Further, Venture capitalists often provide other services as already mentioned in the previous chapter. This could include identifying potential management and executive board, contribution on strategic planning, exploring new markets and supporting in public stock offerings. According to Humphreyson, venture capital companies seek for an ROI of 30 to 50 percent on their investment per year. Furthermore, they try to achieve a minimum market value of 50 - 100 million euros within the first years. In general investors are supposed to reach investment liquidity through an IPO (initial public offering) on the one hand and through direct sale to a public traded company on the other hand. The author Singhal highlights that most of the investors are aware that some projects may cause major losses, others however accrue lucrative returns. If the venture capitalist invests in a company with high growth potentials and additionally adds his expertise to those employees, this funding could return into high profits. However if the investment idea will not hit the market remarkable losses might occur.  

**4.	A software in the due diligence process**
This chapter initially deals with the definition of the due diligence process. Second, the author of this paper, Uljana Figura, will try to figure out how a software could support venture capitalists to evaluate whether to invest in a start-up or not. The author Occhipiniti describes the due diligence generally as a process where investors get a 360-degree view of the company they want to invest in. At the same time it is an assessment of the associated company based on its strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, such an audit is also the beginning of a long-term partnership as the investor and the entrepreneur act as partners in the future. The economist Prengel claims that venture capital firms need to conduct comprehensive technical, commercial, legal and financial due diligence in order to identify risk as well as revenue opportunities. To explain how a due diligence process could look like I refer to the homepage www.deutsche-startups.de knowing that their approach is just one example. According to the German website there are five crucial aspects to consider: The subsequent paragraph deals with the question, “How a software could support venture capitalists to estimate whether to invest in a start-up or not?” 
For this I came up with the following scenario:
Let’s assume economists introduce a software which automatically evaluates all critical components of a business and is only made for venture capital investors. This software is called VentureSpeed and costs 5000 Euro. Such a software may help investors in several ways. With the digitalization, every company is faced with so called “big data”. We can use this fact as an advantage. These days, evermore start-ups safe its data in a business cloud platform, and if not, then this is my assumption. Not only huge can be saved, it is also easy to access. Hence, investors would only need a permission of the company to connect VentureSpeed with their business cloud. The key word for such a scenario is “trust” and if the entrepreneur wants to get subsidized, he will be more likely to provide his data access. For example, information such as education of employees, salaries, legal contracts including regulations, financial statements, articles of association and statutes would then be automatically available through this software. 
Many hours of organizing and categorizing the data would become redundant as VentureSpeed structures it by means of artificial intelligence. VentureSpeed software should be kind of a self-learning system, which constantly improves through the number of searches and activities of the user. Since humans are not able to examine such data bundles in a timely manner, VentureSpeed would largely help investors to examine all important information and consequently accelerate the whole audit.
Another supportive function would be that the software recognizes search patterns and compares already existing searches with new ones. Besides the structure and evaluation function the software also contains a search function. What I mean, is that all published articles and online posts can be found by use of a keyword search. For example, an investor would like to know what was written about runtastic in relation to legal affairs during the last 10 months. The only thing he would need to do is to type keywords such as “runtastic”, “legal”, “prosecution”, “complaint” etc. VentureSpeed then offers all articles that have been written about the ongoing litigation with runtactic. The ideal case would be that not only the head of the department would have access to that software but also the employees which are involved in that project. This is also very time saving owing to the fact that the information needed is not only stored by one employee as it is usually without a software. This additional gain of information would be especially beneficial if two or more start-ups are in line for an investment.  
Finally, VentureSpeed is also in charge of calculations of key figures such as liquidity, profit margin, risk and net working capital. This additionally helps investors to get a full 360-degree view of the enterprises he considers investing in. These ideas and many more can support venture capitalists to evaluate whether to invest in a start-up or not. 


**5.	Conclusion**
To sum up the above mentioned paragraphs it can be said that a due diligence is usually known as a very important process when it comes to investment decisions. With the acquired information the investor gets an overall view of the company he considers to invest in. Critical information such as market position, employee status, legal and financial position need to be evaluated. The biggest shortcut of a due diligence is its time exposure and the difficulty to find all necessary data. For this I came up with the idea to introduce a software called VentureSpeed. This is a self-learning software, which gathers, structures, evaluates and stores all necessary data an investor needs to know whether to invest in a company or not. Not only investors but also his colleagues and employees who are involved in this investment project can use such a software to discover informative articles about the company they want to invest in. VentureSpeed makes the whole audit process more structured, faster, easier and not least it provides the investor with a full 360-degree view of enterprises he considers to invest in.
